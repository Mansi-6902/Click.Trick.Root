This lab is for educational purpose only!!!

### 📘 Introduction

Welcome to this educational TryHackMe room! 🧠💻

In this lab, you'll explore a realistic attack chain designed to help you understand how multiple vulnerabilities—when left unpatched—can be combined to gain deeper access within a system. Each section highlights a different security issue commonly found in real-world environments, offering a hands-on way to learn and apply ethical hacking techniques in a safe and legal environment. 🔐

### 🧪 What You'll Be Learning:

- 🔄 **CSRF – Cross-Site Request Forgery**  
  Learn how a CSRF vulnerability can be used to perform actions on behalf of another user—like deleting an account—when proper request validation is missing.

- 🌍 **SSRF – Server-Side Request Forgery via URL Upload**  
  Discover how SSRF can occur when file upload features allow remote URLs, and how this can be used to access internal-only services.

- 📁 **SMB Enumeration – Credential Discovery**  
  Enumerate accessible SMB shares to uncover sensitive files, demonstrating the risks of insecure file sharing configurations.

- 🔐 **SSH Access & Privilege Escalation**  
  Use discovered credentials to log in via SSH, then analyze the system to find a privilege escalation path—gaining higher-level access through misconfigurations.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives:

✅ Understand the mechanics of CSRF and SSRF vulnerabilities  
✅ Practice network enumeration using SMB  
✅ Chain multiple vulnerabilities for full system access  
✅ Perform safe, hands-on privilege escalation on a Linux target
